      "\n",
      "1. **Gather Requirements**: Let's start by identifying the key features you need. This could include:\n",
      "   - Real-time inventory tracking\n",
      "   - Supplier management\n",
      "   - Purchase order management\n",
      "   - Sales analytics and reporting\n",
      "   - Integration with Point of Sale (POS) systems\n",
      "   - Mobile access for on-the-go management\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **User Stories**: We can create user stories based on the identified features. For example:\n",
      "   - As a café manager, I want to receive alerts when inventory levels are low so that I can reorder supplies on time.\n",
      "   - As a staff member, I want to scan items to update inventory quickly, ensuring accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prioritization**: Prioritize these user stories based on business value and urgency. For example, sales analytics might be immediate due to its impact on business decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sprint Planning**: We can break down the development into sprints, ensuring that the most critical features are addressed first.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Collaboration with Development Team**: I’ll facilitate discussions with the development team during Sprint Planning and daily stand-ups to ensure we stay on track.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Feedback and Iteration**: After each sprint, we can conduct reviews to demo the new functionalities and gather feedback from you and any other stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Continuous Improvement**: During retrospectives, we can discuss what’s working well and what can be improved in the IMS development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following this approach, we can ensure that the IMS is not only robust and scalable but aligns with the needs of your coffee shop. Let’s outline the next steps and initiate discussions about potential vendors or platforms that could help meet these requirements.\n",

      "   - Real-time data pull from the connected POS, ensuring immediate inventory updates after transactions.\n",
      "   - Contains error handling for synchronization issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Database Models\n",
      "1. **Inventory Table**:\n",
      "   - Fields: `item_id`, `item_name`, `quantity`, `reorder_level`, `supplier_id`, `last_updated_at`.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Supplier Table**:\n",
      "   - Fields: `supplier_id`, `supplier_name`, `contact_info`, `communication_log`.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Sales Table**:\n",

      "5. **User Table**:\n",
      "   - Fields: `user_id`, `user_role`, `contact_info`, `last_login`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### API Boundaries\n",
      "1. **Inventory API**:\n",
      "   - Endpoints: `GET /inventory`, `POST /inventory`, `PUT /inventory/:id`, `DELETE /inventory/:id`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Supplier API**:\n",
      "   - Endpoints: `GET /suppliers`, `POST /suppliers`, `PUT /suppliers/:id`, `DELETE /suppliers/:id`.\n",

      "- **Total Estimated Timeline**: **7 days**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scalability and Integration Risks\n",
      "1. **Data Volume**: As the business grows, the volume of inventory and sales data may increase significantly, necessitating scalable databases and effective indexing strategies.\n",
