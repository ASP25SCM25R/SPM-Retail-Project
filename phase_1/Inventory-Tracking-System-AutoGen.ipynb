      "  - **Description**: Verify that a user can successfully register.\n",
      "  - **Preconditions**: No user with the same details exists in the database.\n",
      "  - **Steps**: \n",
      "    1. Send a POST request to `/api/users` with valid user details.\n",
      "  - **Expected Result**: Receive a status 201 response with the user data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Fetch Products\n",
      "- **Test Case ID**: TC02\n",
      "  - **Description**: Verify fetching the list of products.\n",
      "  - **Preconditions**: At least one product exists in the database.\n",
      "  - **Steps**: \n",
      "    1. Send a GET request to `/api/products`.\n",
      "  - **Expected Result**: Receive a status 200 response with a JSON array of product details.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.3 User Authentication\n",
      "- **Test Case ID**: TC03\n",
      "  - **Description**: Verify accessing a protected route with authentication.\n",
      "  - **Preconditions**: Valid user credentials are known.\n",
      "  - **Steps**: \n",
      "    1. Obtain authentication token using user credentials.\n",
      "    2. Send GET request to `/api/protected` with the token in the header.\n",
      "  - **Expected Result**: Receive a status 200 response with a success message.\n",

      "## 5. Conclusion\n",
      "The comprehensive testing strategy encompasses unit testing, integration testing, UAT, performance, and security testing aimed at maintaining high standards of quality for the Inventory Management System (IMS). Maintaining meticulous documentation during the testing phases will ensure transparency and facilitate ongoing improvements. Regular code reviews and refactoring tasks will be essential to achieve a well-structured, maintainable, and efficient codebase.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dedicated approach will ensure the IMS is robust, user-friendly, and aligned with stakeholder expectations before launch. Understanding user feedback through UAT will further refine the system, ensuring long-term success and satisfaction.\n",
