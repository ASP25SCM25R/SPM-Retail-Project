      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The Inventory Management System (IMS) for bags aims to streamline the processes associated with tracking, managing, and controlling the inventory of various bag types. The system should provide an efficient interface for users to manage the inventory, track sales, and generate reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use-Case Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "The following use-cases have been identified for the Inventory Management System for Bags:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **User Registration and Authentication**\n",
      "   - Users should be able to create an account.\n",
      "   - Existing users should be able to log in and out.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add New Bag Inventory**\n",
      "   - Admin users should be able to add new bag types and their details (size, color, brand, quantity, price, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Update Bag Inventory**\n",
      "   - Admin users should update details of existing bags including stock adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Delete Bag Inventory**\n",
      "   - Admin users should be able to remove bags from the inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **View Inventory**\n",
      "   - Users should be able to view a list of all bags and filter/search by criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Sales Management**\n",
      "   - Users should be able to process sales transactions and adjust inventory accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Generate Reports**\n",
      "   - Admin users should be able to generate inventory reports, sales reports, and alerts for low stock items.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Notification System**\n",
      "   - Automatic notifications should be sent for low stock items.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **User Roles and Permissions**\n",
      "   - Different user roles (admin, staff, customer) should be defined with permissions for actions available to each role.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Inventory Reorder Management**\n",
      "    - The system should help manage stock reordering based on defined thresholds.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Tasks\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Requirement Reviews**\n",
      "  - Review each use-case with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Potential Rework**\n",
      "  - Address any feedback or changes requested from stakeholders after the initial reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Effort Calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Step 1: Work**\n",
      "   - Total number of use-case requirements: **10**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Step 2: Productivity Rate**\n",
      "   - Productivity rate: **5 requirements completed every day**\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Step 3: Effort**\n",
      "   - Effort = Work / Productivity = 10 requirements / 5 requirements per day = **2 days**\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "This design document outlines the architecture and design specifications for the Inventory Management System (IMS) for bags. The aim is to provide a detailed blueprint to facilitate the development and deployment of the system based on the previously identified requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. System Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1 Overview\n",
      "The IMS will be a web-based application that communicates with a backend server, a database to store inventory data, and a user interface for interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Components\n",
      "- **Frontend:** User interface for users to interact with the system.\n",
      "- **Backend:** API layer to handle business logic, authentication, and data processing.\n",
      "- **Database:** Storage for bag inventory, user details, and transaction records.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Use Cases Design\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1 User Registration and Authentication\n",
      "- **Entities:** User\n",
      "- **Processes:** Registration with validation checks, login/logout functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2 Bag Inventory Management\n",
      "- **Add/Update/Delete Inventory**\n",
      "  - Processes to handle CRUD operations for bags in the system.\n",
