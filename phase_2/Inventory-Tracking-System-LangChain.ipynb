      "### Identified Blockers and Mitigation Plans\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Blocker:** Insecure deserialization in the assembly guide module.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Plan:** Prioritize refactoring the code to eliminate insecure deserialization. Assign a dedicated developer to focus on this task and ensure it is completed before the next sprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Blocker:** Hardcoded credentials in the adjustability interface codebase.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Plan:** Implement a secure configuration management system to handle credentials. Conduct a code review to ensure all hardcoded credentials are removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Blocker:** Misconfigured firewall rules.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Plan:** Collaborate with the security team to audit and reconfigure firewall settings. Schedule a dedicated session to address this issue before deploying to production.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blocker:** Outdated third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Plan:** Update all libraries to their latest versions. Establish a regular update schedule to prevent similar issues in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Blocker:** Insufficient test coverage in certain areas.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Plan:** Allocate additional resources to write and execute test cases for uncovered areas. Use test coverage metrics to track progress and ensure comprehensive testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these blockers with the proposed mitigation plans, we aim to enhance the team's efficiency and ensure the successful delivery of the ergonomic chair project.\n",
