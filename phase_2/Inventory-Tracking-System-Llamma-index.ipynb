      "   - **Vulnerability**: Inadequate input validation for CRUD operations could lead to SQL Injection attacks.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Implement parameterized queries and input validation to sanitize user inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Vulnerability**: Sensitive supplier information may be exposed due to improper access controls.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to supplier management features based on user roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Vulnerability**: Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Use TLS for data in transit and encrypt sensitive data stored in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **User Story 4: Order Management**\n",
      "   - **Vulnerability**: Insecure direct object references could allow users to access or manipulate orders they do not own.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Implement checks to ensure users can only access their own orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the UI could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Sanitize and escape all user inputs and outputs in the UI.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Vulnerability**: Insufficient logging and monitoring of order management actions.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Implement logging for all CRUD operations and monitor logs for suspicious activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mitigation Plan\n",
      "1. **Input Validation and Parameterized Queries**: \n",
      "   - Implement input validation for all user inputs in CRUD operations.\n",

      "   - Implement checks in the backend to enforce these permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Data Encryption**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.\n",
      "   - Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES for data at rest, TLS for data in transit).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Access Control Checks**:\n",
      "   - Implement checks in the order management functionality to ensure users can only access their own orders.\n",
      "   - Validate user permissions before allowing any CRUD operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **XSS Protection**:\n",
      "   - Sanitize and escape all user inputs and outputs in the UI to prevent XSS attacks.\n",
