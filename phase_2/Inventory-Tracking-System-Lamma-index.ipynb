      "   - Implement CSP and sanitize user inputs.\n",
      "   - Conduct regular security testing (e.g., penetration testing) on the front-end application.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Alert System Security**\n",
      "   - Review and validate alert generation logic.\n",
      "   - Use secure communication methods for alert notifications.\n",
      "\n",
